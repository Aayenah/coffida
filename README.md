# CoffiDa Mobile App

## Introduction

A mobile app for finding and reviewing cafes, developed using React Native. The app uses an API provided by CoffiDa and implements all 17 endpoints. This project was part of an assignment for a university module titled "Mobile Applications Development".

## Core Features

- Find nearby cafes
- Add cafe to favourites
- Add/edit/delete owned reviews
- Like/unlike a review
- Add photo to owned reviews
- Search by name, ratings, group (e.g. favourites)
- Authentication flow
- Update user profile
- Change password

## Style Guide

I decided to use Airbnb Style Guide for this project. This is the first time I enforce a style guide on a project so it took time to setup eslint with Airbnb style and Prettier formatter. I will enforce this style in my future projects.

I had to disable some rules in some files such as import/named and react/jsx-wrap-multilines because I could not get rid of the errors no matter what I tried. The import/named rule would show an error when I import functions from other modules even when they're exported and work as expected. I will into this in future projects.
